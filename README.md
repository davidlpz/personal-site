# Personal site

This is a simple personal site that I've made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), based on the [project template for Svelte apps](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```
cd personal-site
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and you should see the web running.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version to deploy:

```
npm run build
```
